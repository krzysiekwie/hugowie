At work I’ve been meeting IT managers and experienced developers and felt a great gap between their expertise and my limited understanding of programming. Only recently I realised that apart from day-to-day practice and specialisation there is little that an average junior developer knows or deals with, that I can’t understand.

When I study I like to be in the flow of what I’m doing and that comes regardless of where I am. Most of my learning nowadays happens online so “in front of the screen” is the place, wherever the screen may be. I like to limit (or prompt) my distractions with a bit of background white noise but don’t really use an app for that. For high-focus / new material, it’s music - mostly classical which might be funny because in general I’m a heavy metal guy. For things I consider diffuse or review it’s usually just TV set to low volume. As far as apps go, I’m used to capturing notes in markdown but prefer to diagram on paper.

These kind of changes involve breaking through unique personal challenges you face in these areas. So before moving on to Week 2, take a minute to reflect on one or more specific challenges you hope this course will help you break through, and share this with your fellow learners. In the final week, we’ll come back to this point and ask you to share how your breakthrough journey has gone so far! You can help inspire us all! I’m taking part in a learn-to-code challenge. For around 30 years I’ve been tinkering with code in various areas but always treated that as a hobby and only challenged myself when I had a problem I needed to solve. In other words I’ve been staying in my comfort zone and only learned new skills/ languages/ framework if they were coming easy to me. What I’m hoping to do with the help of this course is to both broaden and deepen my passion for coding into the areas and to the level that is truly challenging and discouraging. I’m hoping to push my limits in serverside node \u0026 python, data analysis (maths and statistics) and possibly also general (more academic) CS.
