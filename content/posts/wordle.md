I didn't really feel the need to share Wordle with others. And then I saw an [article](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/11/secret-winning-wordle-word-game) about it in Guardian. 

It's a really effective and well structured explanation of how phonotactics (sonority sequencing) works in building words. And I needed en example of how to explain complex matters in a simple way for one of the courses I teach. The fact that the author of Wordle is the same guy who was behind the reddit place was an extra incentive.

And then the world was getting mad. I started seeing tips about saving the page for offline/mobile use (it's practically a stand-alone app that works inside your browser) - oddly enough I have not seen the one about deleting cookies to have more guesses (maybe because it also deletes the streak of wins).
