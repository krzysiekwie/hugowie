- It's always helpful to visualise where you are and where you want to be.
- When I teach developers to use English I like to use this Observable to diagram their areas of interests and needs across the standard EFL scope.
- [This notebook](https://observablehq.com/@englisht/whats-on-your-radar#) lets them think about what they need and want to improve on and having me make the necessary changes to the code (or they can fork it) is a good first attempt at talking someone (me) through some code they're not entirely familiar with.
