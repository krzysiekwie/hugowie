## Mindshift: Break Through Obstacles to Learning and Discover Your Hidden Potential

by McMaster University
[on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mindshift/home/welcome)

[Week 1]({{< ref "mindshift-learning.md" >}})
[Week 2]({{< ref "mindshift-learning-2.md" >}})

## Week 3

### noradrenaline

interconnected with serotonin: mental and physical activity, sustained motivation and drive

### dopamine

high levels good mood, energized, extroverted
increased weight of reward (thus key in positive reinforcement training)
goes up with **_unexpected reward_** appearance
goes down with non-appearance of an expected reward

### Pushback

#### dabble

learn gradually and slowly, and grow with the change, letting others adapt

#### double life

hide learning from others and don't give them a chance to try and talk you out of it

#### counter

push back at pushback - the more others tell you something is impossible, the harder you work to disprove them (but be realistic about judging your progress)

solicit valid criticism and listen to it.

### General competence vs Selective Ignorance

One of the best things to do is to gain _general competence_ in all aspects of the new area.

BUT

It's not always good to be a jack of all trades and a go-to person for everyone. It's okay to have areas to be purposefully _selectively ignorant_ about in order to be able to focus on your own goals.

### Value of Impostor Syndrome

Instead of fighting it, be open to self-doubt. It is helpful in counteracting over-confidence. Value doubt, but don't give in to it completely.

In the long run it's about persistence and flexibility, not genius.

Week 4: coming soon
